/**
 * All things in this package should be finite defined static fields
 * TODO make so that def's is NOT in the save file object graph. one way to do this is define a external format of this def, and give each def a unique integer
 *
 * THE THING is, logic-wise, all these things is compatible, but we don't provide a fully configurable pipeline of rendering, all things of the similar def have a fixed rendering method, with only a little configuration available. actually, the game logic DOESN'T care about the the configurations at all
